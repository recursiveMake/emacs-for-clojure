;; These customizations make it easier for you to navigate files,
;; switch buffers, and choose options from the minibuffer.


;; "When several buffers visit identically-named files,
;; Emacs must give the buffers distinct names. The usual method
;; for making buffer names unique adds ‘<2>’, ‘<3>’, etc. to the end
;; of the buffer names (all but one of them).
;; The forward naming method includes part of the file's directory
;; name at the beginning of the buffer name

;; ido-mode allows you to more easily navigate choices. For example,
;; when you want to switch buffers, ido presents you with a list
;; of buffers in the the mini-buffer. As you start to type a buffer's
;; name, ido will narrow down the list of buffers to match the text
;; you've typed in

;; This allows partial matches, e.g. "tl" will match "Tyrion Lannister"
(setq ido-enable-flex-matching t)

;; Turn this behavior off because it's annoying
(setq ido-use-filename-at-point nil)

;; Don't try to match file across all "work" directories; only match files
;; in the current directory displayed in the minibuffer
(setq ido-auto-merge-work-directories-length -1)

;; Includes buffer names of recently open files, even if they're not
;; open now
(setq ido-use-virtual-buffers t)

;; This enables ido in all contexts where it could be useful, not just
;; for selecting buffer and file names
(ido-ubiquitous-mode 1)

;; For any case where ido cannot be used, there is another older mode called
;; icomplete-mode that integrates with standard emacs completion and adds
;; some ido-like behavior.

;; instead of completing-read. You can get ido completion for these
;; commands with crm-custom-mode, which replaces completing-read-multiple
;; with repeated calls to completing-read, which would then use ido
;; thanks to ido-ubiquitous-mode.
